ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It enables developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, leading to efficient updates and rendering. React uses a virtual DOM, which optimizes performance by updating only the components that change, rather than reloading the entire page. Its component-based architecture makes it flexible and easy to maintain, allowing for scalable and dynamic web applications. React supports hooks for managing state and side effects in functional components, making it a powerful tool for building modern, interactive web apps.
